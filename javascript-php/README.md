# JavaScript & PHP Example

```bash
git clone https://github.com/solnetdigital/standards-and-tooling-examples.git
cd standards-and-tooling-examples/javascript-php
npm install
composer install
npm run lint
```

Note that pre-commit hook will not work in this repository, though the gulpfile and npm/composer configuration is correct.

To function correctly, the `package.json`, `composer.json` and `gulpfile.js` must be at the root of a repository.
